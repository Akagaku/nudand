  <h1>Character Creation</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to boot camp. In this section, you'll find a step-by-step guide to character creation in fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons.
    Everything you need to know, from point-buy to proficiecny bonus. We'll also be making an example character so you can get a feel for the
    workflow.
  </p>

  <h1 id="race">Race</h1>
  <p>
    Like in real life, everything in D&D always come back to race. Unlike in real life, you get to pick your race, and no one is definitively
    better than another. Except half-elves. They're crazy good in basically every edition of the game, for some reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the races available to you in Dungeons and Dragons are <em>way</em> more interesting than the boring ones you get in real life. You don't
    just roll the dice and get stuck as a Bolivian for 60 years. You get to be like an elf or an orc or a dragon person or something.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find a list of playable races in the <em>Resources</em> menu. The ones listed on this site encompass only those which are present in
    my game. To account for every official race would be a herculean task, since the number has more than quintupled since 2014. (And in that
    time, only one new class!)
  </p>

    <h2 id="racial-traits">Racial Traits</h2>
    <p>
      There wouldn't be much point in having a bunch of different races if they were all the same. The things that make them different are what
      make them unique and interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's where racial traits come in: a number of different stat bonuses and mechanical differences that distinguish the races from one
      another. Though each race has its own lineup of special traits, every one shares these five:
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Most races provide a couple bonuses to your ability scores (more on those later), based
        on culture and physiology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Functionally useless stat. Basically just for you to decide what age your character is at the beginning of
        the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Barely any applications in 5e, but you'll need to know it if you want to grapple a bigger creature. Small
        creatures can also move through larger creatures' spaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> This stat determines how far you can move in a single turn. It's normally related to size, but dwarves
        are an exception: with a Medium size and a Small speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> This just tells you what languages you can speak. Most settings have a "Common" tongue, or something
        similarly boring in name.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h1 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h1>
  <p>
    Okay, now pay attention, because this part is important. This is the part of the character sheet you'll be consulting every time you roll the
    dice for the entire game. Your <em>ability scores</em> are measures of your character's innate physical/mental capabilities, ranked on a scale
    from 1 to 20. There are six in total:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Strength.</em></strong> Raw physical power and athleticism. Used for hitting hard, climbing walls, and lifting heavy things.
      This stat is used in the calculation of most melee damage rolls.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Dexterity.</em></strong> Speed, reflexes, and agility. (Yes, I know Dexterity is fine motor function of the hands and fingers,
      but this game disagrees.) Used to keep your balance, dodge attacks, and aim ranged weapons.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Constitution.</em></strong> Resistance and fortitude. Used to not get sick, not get poisoned, and not breathe for a long time
      without dying. This stat has an effect on your total hit points. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Intelligence.</em></strong> Ironically, not intelligence. Instead of smart, this stat makes you well-studied. Used for
      remembering things and knowing things in general. Spellcasting ability for artificers and wizards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Wisdom.</em></strong> Intuition, perceptiveness, and quick thinking. Used to survive in nature, spot hidden things, and detect
      lies. Spellcasting abiltiy for clerics, druids, and rangers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Charisma.</em></strong> Likability, force of personality, and persuasiveness. Used to convince people, lie to people, and not
      get possessed by demons. Spellcasting ability for bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <p>
      Okay, I may have fibbed a little right out the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      You won't be consulting your ability scores every time you roll the dice. In fact, unless you want to know how long you can jump with a
      running start or know how much weight you can carry, you'll almost never consult them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why are they even there?
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is ability scores are just a relic of older editions. They're only still in the game because oldheads and traditionalists (me)
      would cry and scream if they were taken out. The <em>real</em> important numbers are your ability score <strong>modifiers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modifier for any ability score is equal to the score, divided by two (rounded down), minus five. Or, you can just use this
      nifty table I made up just for you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ability-score-generation">Ability Score Generation</h2>
    <p>
      "But how does one know one's ability scores?" you may be asking. Well, there are actually a few different ways to figure out your stat
      lineup. All of them are viable options (well, most of them are), and each DM tends to favor one over the others.
    </p>
    <p><em>
      Remember: Add on your racial ability score changes <strong>after</strong> you've determined your scores with one of the below methodsâ€”not
      before!
    </em></p>

      <h3 id="4d6">The Classic</h3>
      <p>
        This method is also known as the 4d6 method, or the "4d6 drop one" method, for reasons which will become apparent in a second. Get your
        favored six-sided dice, and roll four of them. Take away the lowest roll, and add the remaining three. The sum is your score. Do this once
        for each ability score.
      </p>
      <p>
        This follows the sentiment of "get a number between 3 and 18" from back in first edition, but favors numbers at the upper end of that
        range to distinguish your character from the average person.
      </p>

      <h3 id="standard-array">The Standard</h3>
      <p>
        Do random numbers scare you? Do you prefer to keep away from gambling? Pussy. This is probably the method for you. Instead of rolling
        dice, you get an array of 15/14/13/12/10/8. Use each number exactly once, for whichever ability score you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one actually isn't that bad. You get some good scores, some average scores, and one pretty bad score. Instant character archetype!
      </p>

      <h3 id="point-buy">The Calculator</h3>
      <table class="table table-striped" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px; width: 150px;">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Score</th>
            <th>Cost</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>7</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>9</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        The standard array is cool, but it sacrifices a lot of variety and customizability for the sake of simplicity. Excellent for new players
        or getting a quick start, but not so much for making unique and varied characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that sounds like what you're thinking, or you're an accountant by trade, this may just be the method for you: point buy. Instead of
        being handed your ability scores or rolling for them, you crunch some numbers to find out what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each score has a point cost. A score of 8 is free, and you have to spend points to move up from there. So, two scores of 13 would cost 10
        points, one score of 15 and one score of 12 would cost 11 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this fun little numbers game is to get an ability score array you're happy with, without spending more than 27 points. Funny
        enough, the standard array costs <em>exactly</em> 27 points.
      </p>

      <h3 id="3d6">The Fuck You</h3>
      <p>
        Taking off the kid gloves for this one. This method isn't too dissimilar from the classic, but with one key difference: the number of
        dice. No more 4d6 drop one. Fuck that. 3d6 drop nothing. Pure, unfiltered random chance from 3-18. This is how shit got done in first and
        second edition.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's that? You rolled four 3's? No you didn't actuallyâ€”your DM rolled it for you. But at least you get to choose two good abilities,
        right? No you don't, actually. They're rolled in order. Fuck you.
      </p>

      <h3 id="colville">The Colville</h3>
      <p>
        To be completely transparent, this isn't officially sanctioned. It was created by Matthew Colville, a popular D&D YouTuber, and
        professional writer and game designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with 4d6 drop one, <em>but</em> roll in order, starting with Strength. Once you've rolled and added your racial bonuses, give it the
        once-over. If you don't have at least two scores of 15 or higher, start over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is to break new players' pre-conceived notions of their characters, which are often based on other characters or some weird
        edgelord fantasy. Or something intentionally obtuse like a guy who lights things on fire for no reason other than to be annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        By making players <em>discover</em> their characters, you prevent the frustration of failing to create a character the game wasn't
        designed to accomodate, and you create a fun and useful exercise for practicing roleplaying skills.
      </p>

  <h1 id="class">Class</h1>
  <p>
    Now <em>this</em> is where things get good. Take a look at your character sheet. Just at random. Close your eyes, pick up the sheet, hold it
    in front of you, and then open your eyes again. Odds are you're looking at a stat determined by your class. That's how impactful a choice it
    is.

      Have you ever played a video game? In that video game, was your character's general <em>aliveness</em> represented by a value labeled
      "health" or "vitality"? If so, say "Thank you, Gary Gygax."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dungeons and Dragons was the first ever game to use hit points to track aliveness. Before D&D, the closest thing we had was the number of
      men left alive in each unit in your favorite war game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since video games run on computers, they use exponents and complex equations to determine hit points. But TSR thought it was better if you
      didn't need a calculator to play. So your retarded ass is in luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer they settled on was rolling dice. It is a dice game, after all. Is the random element of hit point generation a little annoying?
      Sometimes, but it balances out the more you roll. Take a statistics class, dummy. And is it more simple than the equation Dark Souls uses
      for Vitality? <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/vigor_health.png">Absolutely</a>.
